15 minute discharge data is taken from
/projects/The_Env_Virtual_observatory/Sub_Daily_Hydrological_Data/Discharge/River Flow Data 15minute/Processed_csv_files

Iskra wrote the python code to convert 15-minute data to hourly data.
Hourly data for a given hour is the average of the values on :15, :30, :45 and :00.
If in any of those times, there's a NaN, the code writes out -9999.0000000000 for the entire hour.
